I have been learning Javascript for sometime now. To practice and implement I have learnt, i decided to pickup little projects. Then I  noticed a friend who periodically check on me, a mentor I guess; doesn't have porfolio website and he is a backend developer who writes NodeJS and "In GO he trust". So I decided to flex my tiny frontend muscles and develop one for him. Is either he is too busy to with freelance gigs or he is a bit lazy to code it up since it belongs to him, no deadline, no HR or project manager to question him. There are chances that he wouldn't like it or don't even need it. You know how weird backend guys can be, but what do i have to loose...lol. Enough Yadda yadda yadda, so that's how that project was birthed.

For the picture there, not him though. From Twitter to Instagram, I coundn't find his picture. Remember I told you he is backEnd guy. Wisdom no dey take pictures.
