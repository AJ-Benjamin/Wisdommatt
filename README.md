I have been learning Javascript for sometime now. To practice and implement I have learnt, i decided to pickup little projects. Then I  noticed a mentor doesn't have porfolio website and he is a backend developer who writes NodeJS and "In GO he trust". So I decided to flex my tiny frontend and develop one for him. Is either he too busy to with freelance gigs or he is bit lazy to code it up since it belongs to him, no deadline, no watch dog one. There are chances that he wouldn't like it or don't even need it. You know how weird backend guys can be, but what do i have to loose...lol.
For the picture there, not him though. From Twitter to Instagram, i coundn't find any picture. Remember I told you he is backEnd guy.
